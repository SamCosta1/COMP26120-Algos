	How to write, compile, debug and run C programs on Linux
	========================================================

There are some prompts below, but you should add anything else you think
will be useful.

Useful sources of information
=============================
The man page for gcc (man gcc)

Writing C programs
==================

printf command:

Access to information by typing `man 3 printf`


Compiling C programs
====================
-std compiler parameter - Dictates the language standard the compiler should use
-Wall compiler parameter - "enables all the warnings about constructions that
some users consider questionable" - gcc man page. Essentially displays all
warnings as well as errors.

Errors from omitting #include line:

HelloWorld.c: In function ‘main’:
HelloWorld.c:5:3: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘printf’
 [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
   printf("Hello world!\n");
   ^
HelloWorld.c:5:3: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in
 function ‘printf’ [enabled by default]


Ie printf is not recognized (or rather compiler has no access to the definition
of printf)

Linking C programs
==================

Need to specify a linker flag of -lm to compiler

Running C programs
==================

run C program prog by typing ./prog


Comparing output from C and Java programs
=========================================

The only difference was the number of decimal places the mean salary was quoted
to.
Java:	24626.666666666668
C:		24626.666667

Though the code doesn't explicitly do any rounding. So Java's output
is slighty more accurate. Though slightly misleading since the
the correct answer has the 6 recurring,.
